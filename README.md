# CurrencyApp
Little project with api, it show the converse currency with Argentinian Peso,
to Dolar, Euro and Real. 

 i use the next free api:

this api, update every 30 minutes.

to used, you only have to dowload the project,then, go to the terminal,
navigate to the folder, where is the app, and then.

```
cd currency
npm start

```

that will iniciate the react project in 
>localhost:3000

in there, will display the page with the currency.

if you wanna use with rest api

dowload the files, open the folder, to start the server in localhost:3000, you con do it with 

'''

'''

then in the local browser will show the currency

if you wanna get the json file of the currency, you can go to:
>http://localhost:3000/cotizacion/dolar
